AI SOIL CLASSIFIER

Overview:-

This project leverages Google Cloud AI Vertex, TensorFlow Lite, and Kotlin to classify soil types and provide crop recommendations. The model achieves 85% accuracy in classifying 11 different soil types and is optimized for real-time predictions on mobile devices.

Technologies Used:-

Google Cloud AI Vertex – Trained a deep learning model for soil classification.

TensorFlow Lite – Deployed a lightweight version of the model for mobile applications.

Kotlin – Developed an Android app to capture soil data and display predictions.

Features:-

Soil Type Classification – Detects 11 different soil types with high accuracy.

Real-time Predictions – Uses TensorFlow Lite for fast and efficient inference on mobile devices.

Crop Recommendations – Suggests suitable crops based on soil type.

Usage:-

Open the app and upload soil image using the device.

The app classifies the soil type and provides an accuracy score.

Based on the soil type, the app suggests the best crops to grow.

Model Training Details:-

Dataset: Collected soil data with 11 different classes.

Trained using Google Cloud AI Vertex.

Achieved 85% accuracy after multiple optimizations.
